            <h1>Design Principles</h1>

            <div>
                <p>The challenge is to develop an application that tries to increase the user's participation in team
                    sports
                    through online communities. Several factors play into the success of this concept. It is not
                    possible to
                    achieve this goal if the application is not properly designed. To achieve this, design principles of
                    several
                    disciplines are applied to achieve a user-centric solution.

            <h1>User Experience Design</h1>

            <div>
                <p>
                    The term "user experience" was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at
                    Apple (NORMAN, 2013, P. XIII F.). User experience comprises all aspects of a user's interaction with
                    a
                    company, its services, and its products. The focus and most important goal of good user experience
                    is to
                    meet the user's needs in every aspects. Close cooperation is required between different disciplines,
                    such as engineering, marketing, graphic design, industrial design, and interface design (NORMAN &
                    NIELSEN, N.D.).

                    »Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit
                    our
                    needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad
                    design,
                    on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.«

                User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given product, from the visuals,
                the
                haptics, and the audio to how the product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary
                factors: its look, feel, and usability (IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04).

                        The “look” satisfes the user’s visual expectations of the product. It is about creating a
                        product
                        that is visually appealing and conveys the essence of the product
                        to the user. In addition to pure aesthetics, it is also important that the content is
                        communicated simply and understandably. Therefore, it is not only important
                        how the product looks like but also how information is presented

                    <blockquote>
                        The “feel” is about creating products that are not only functional but also fun to
                        use. It is important that it is a pleasant and intuitive experience when interacting with the
                        product on a daily basis.

                    <blockquote>
                        Usability is the cornerstone of user experience because if a product is diffcult
                        to use, the experience of using it will never be positive. Products should be designed to meet
                        the
                        needs of the user, and the product’s functions should be predictable for the user.

                    User Experience Design requires a solid understanding of the psychology and behavior of the user.
                    Understanding how users perceive a product allows user experience designers to iterate their
                    concepts
                    and better achieve the user's goals. According to Marc Hassenzahl and Sarah Diefenbach's paper
                    *Well-being*, *Need Fulfillment*, and *Experience Design*, any positive experience is based on
                    meeting
                    psychological needs. The fulfillment of psychological needs, such as competence, relatedness,
                    popularity, stimulation and security, contributes to the well-being of the user and leads to a
                    pleasant
                    user experience. In experience design, these needs are taken as guidelines and inspiration in the
                    design
                    process (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).</p>

                    Some of these needs have already been discussed in Chapter 2.1, but in the following, they are
                    considered from the perspective of emotion, while additional needs are addressed.

                            Security is the feeling of having stability and control over one's own life, rather than
                            feeling
                            uncertain and threatened by circumstances one cannot control (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012,

                <blockquote>
                    As discussed in Chapter 2.1, the social aspect is an important factor in motivating people to
                    participate in various activities. Thus, it is also an important factor for participation in sports.
                    Since this thesis addresses the question of how online sports community apps should be designed to
                    increase the user's participation in team sports, the focus during the design phase is laid
                    especially
                    on relatedness.
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user needs”. In addition to the
                    approach of Hassenzahl and Diefenbach, other approaches define user needs for good user experience.
                    Design leader Stephen P. Anderson, for example, developed the “User Experience Hierarchy of Needs”
                    model
                    (→ FIG. 05). Rather than focusing on the psychological side of the user needs, this model is based
                    on a
                    product's maturity process. Anderson proposes that products proceed through six stages of maturity,
                    during which they can grow from a purely functional product, to a product that is meaningful to the
                    user
                    (ANDERSON, 2011, P. 10F.).
